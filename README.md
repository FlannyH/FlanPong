# FlanPong
As suggested in the Retro Games Programming Guild at BUas, I made a Pong clone in C, running on the original Game Boy

# Compiling
To compile the project, install GBDK-2020 so that the bin folder is located at `C:\GBDK\bin`.
Alternatively, change the path in the Makefile to fit your install
